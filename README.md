Hi,
I have more than 10 years of experience working with big data.

At first i was part of the data extraction team in the beginning of data pipeline process, where I gained SQL experience on OLTP side in MySQL DB and analyzed data via BI Tableau tool. In this department I became a team leader of a small team of 5 members and got the Scrum master certification. In this role i worked closely with Backend Java Devs and OLTP DBA.

So because data is my passion, when the opportunity came up I became Data Quality Assurance Engineer. In this role I am a part of Data Engeenering team, working closely with DWH and ETL devs, and participating in Data SRE project. I have been performing manual testing for DWH, ETL and incremental data feeds. Improving data quality through attention to details. Maintaining quality in data delivery pipeline. Used Apache Airflow tool to automate manual routine testing and in bundle with Pager Duty replaced old Nagios tool to have proactive alerting incident during Data SRE project. Using knowledge of python + sql I make commits in some production ETL parts.

As a summary I have worked at both edge of data pipeline process at the beginning in OLTP and at the end in DWH.
So I am experienced Data Quality Assurance Engineer who aspires to be a fully Data Engineer.
